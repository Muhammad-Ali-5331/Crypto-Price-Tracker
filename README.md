## Documentation

[Full Project Documentation](https://github.com/Muhammad-Ali-5331/Crypto-Price-Tracker#readme)## FAQ

#### Why is my email going to spam?
Emails sent via services like SendGrid may land in spam due to sender reputation, content, or unverified domains. Always verify your sender email in SendGrid and avoid spammy content.

#### Can I use my university email (e.g., bsef23a021@pucit.edu.pk)?
You can, but university domains may have stricter filters. It's better to use a verified personal Gmail or domain-based email for higher deliverability.

#### How do I load a specific `.env` file from a different folder?
You can use `dotenv.load_dotenv('../sendgrid.env')` to load env vars from the parent directory.

#### What's the difference between SendGrid and SMTP variables?
- **SendGrid**: Uses `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDER_EMAIL`, `RECEIVER_EMAIL`.
- **SMTP (e.g., Gmail)**: Uses `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`.

#### What APIs does this project use?
- [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) for live crypto prices.
- [Exchangerate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for USD to PKR exchange rate.

## Lessons Learned

While building this Crypto Price Tracker, I learned how to integrate multiple APIs (CoinGecko and ExchangeRate-API) to fetch real-time financial data. I also explored sending dynamic HTML email reports using SendGrid and handling environment variables securely with `.env` files. 

A major challenge was ensuring accurate currency conversion and calculating profits after deducting platform fees. Another was dealing with email delivery issues like spam filtering, which I addressed through verified domains and cleaner HTML structure.

This project helped me understand the importance of automation, modular coding practices, and platform compatibility when scheduling recurring scripts.
